Courses
=======

The course materials available so far are mainly based on the
`Open Source Radar Short Course <https://github.com/openradar/open_source_radar_short_course>`_
which was carried out at the `ERAD 2014 <http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/erad2014/>`_ for the very first time.

The courses are based on the `IPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_. 

Once you have logged into the VM, run the command 

``$ ./start_notebook.sh``.

Then open a browser window on your host machine and navigate to http://127.0.0.0:8888/tree. 
From here, you can browse through the available IPython notebooks.

You can also access the course repositories directly:

* `Py-ART course <https://github.com/EVS-ATMOS/pyart_short_course>`_
* `wradlib course <https://bitbucket.org/heisterm/wradlib_short_course>`_
* `BALTRAD course <https://github.com/DanielMichelson/baltrad_short_course>`_
* `BALTRAD 2 wradlib interoperability demo <https://github.com/heistermann/baltrad2wradlib>`_
* `Py-ART 2 BALTRAD interoperability demo <https://github.com/jjhelmus/pyart2baltrad>`_
* `Radx course <https://github.com/heistermann/radx_short_course>`_ *(as yet very brief)*
