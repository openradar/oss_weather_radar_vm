Courses
=======

The course materials available so far are mainly based on the
`Open Source Radar Short Course <https://github.com/openradar/open_source_radar_short_course>`_
which was carried out at the `ERAD 2014 <http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/erad2014/>`_ for the very first time.

The courses are based on the `IPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_. 

Once you have logged into the VM, run the command 

``$ ./start_notebook.sh``.

Then open a browser window on your host machine and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree. 
From here, you can browse through the available IPython notebooks.

You can also access the course repositories directly:

* `Py-ART course <https://github.com/openradar/pyart_short_course>`_
* `wradlib course <http://wradlib_short_course.bitbucket.org>`_
* `BALTRAD course <https://github.com/DanielMichelson/baltrad_short_course>`_
* `BALTRAD 2 wradlib interoperability demo <https://github.com/heistermann/baltrad2wradlib>`_
