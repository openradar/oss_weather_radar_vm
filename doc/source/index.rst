Towards Cross-Platform Weather Radar Science
============================================

...by introducing a community-based open Virtual Machine.
-------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, various Open Source Software (OSS) tools have become available 
to the weather radar community (see `here <http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00240.1>`_).

On these pages, we present a Virtual Machine (VM) as a turn-key solution 
to run and combine a number of weather radar software packages in a single environment: 
reliable, reproducible, scalable, and extendable.
